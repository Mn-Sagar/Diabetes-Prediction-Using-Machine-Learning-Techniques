# Diabetes-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning-Algorithms
 I used following machine learning algorithms and compare there accuracy
 1. Decision Tree
 2. Random forest
 3. Logistic Regression
 4. SVM
 5. Deep learning aka Multi layer perceptron.
 Dataset used in this project is popular diabetes dataset from UCI machine learning repository.
 Enjoy !!
